  ## Installation 
  Step One: Clone the repo. Step Two: Fill out the config.json with the required info. Step Three: do `npm install` to install the requirements. Step 4: do `node deploy-commands` to make sure everything works right. Step 5: Do `node index.js` or `node .` to start the bot.

  ## Usage 
  This is a command-line application (of course, since it uses node.js)

  ## Contributing 
  Will eventually create issue templates to make things easier. If you have any questions, check the FAQ, and if you're still confused, post a comment in the discussion thread.

  ## Tests
  I don't really know how node's testing works, but try running npm test
